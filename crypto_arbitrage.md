Dear Mr. Vice Presedent.
In the .ipynb file you will find extensive analysis comparing the first quarter closing prices from the popular bitcoin exchanges Bitstamp and Coinbase. 
The purpose of the analysis is to see what if any oppertunities there are in performing arbitrage between these two exchanges. 
I broke the data sets down into 3 periods consiting of a 24 hour trading period. The first being 1/1/18 early in the quarter, 2/15/18 aproxemitly half way through the quarter and finally 3/28/18.
I made extensive comments through out the analysis but to the conclusion is that as the price of bitcoin rose and more and more investors took advantage of the arbitrage oppertunites the markets corrected the imbalance and profitiable oppertunites have all but disapeared. 
The raw data for this analysis was gathered from the bitstamp.csv and coinbase.csv from the prespective quarter.
